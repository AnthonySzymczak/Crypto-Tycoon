Welcome to the in-game Shop! Here you can purchase all of your upgrades to get mining at faster hash rates. Like in real life there is a tax on the items you purchase, so beware not all the prices are as they seem!

2) Random events that will happen as you mine! (Anthony is most excited for this feature release.)
3) multiple shop's and different upgrades
4) An in-game map
and much much more!
